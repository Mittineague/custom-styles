# custom-styles  

A simple plugin that demonstrates an alternate way of applying CSS rules other than via the Admin Customize interface.  
As examples, restoring square Avatars and showing a bear face in the Admin Dashboard.

Also, currently the only way to deactivate this plugin is to uninstall it.
